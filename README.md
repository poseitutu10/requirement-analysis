# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Analyze requirements
2. To prevent scope creeping
3. Document requirements
4. Prioritize requirements needed

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering
2. Requirement Elicitation
3. Requirement Documentation
4. Requirement analysis and modeling
5. Requirement Validation

## Types of Requirements.
1. Functional requirements: This shows what the system should do
2. Non-functional requirements: This shows how the system should perform

## Use Case Diagrams.
Use Diagrams are diagrammatic representation of how users interact with systems for software development
